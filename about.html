    <p>I've been buying and selling sneakers for about two years now. However, my experinece of buying and selling products for resell goes way back since my days of high school. I always seeked ways to try to gain extra profit for myself. 
      I entered the sneaker businsess after constanly being upset unable to secure personal sneakers for myself. I knew a majority of sneaker stock constanly went to sneaker-botters that used advanced software and methods to often gain multiple pairs of sneakers compared to the regular average joe.
      The beginning was diffcult but in the long run this industry opened my eyes to how insane this business can get!People are always willing to pay a certain amount for a specific product their seeking. Some sneaker flips are decent profit such as $50-100 after securing for retail and some could be huge flips as much as 1k plus profit. There are various different factors that take place to help resellers determine if a product will resell good. For example, stock amount, general hype, price, and accessibility are some indicators that play a role in this.  Many within this community had made sneaker-reselling their main occupation.I've made thousands already from being in this market and I plan to increase my business in the future. </p>

  <div class="bio">This is a personal screenshot from a popular bot I've used known as Valor.With a retail price of $249 for the first three months, then $49.99 per month,Valor is one of the leading sneaker bots in the community. It's very difficult to obtain this bot.Currently, the advanced software sits at a price of nearly $5-7k just for a copy! When I used this bot, I received a free copy from my sneaker group for a week use.I'm still trying to obtain a permamnent copy since April for retail! <br>**(I sold each pair for at least $200+)
